#summary Initial wiki page for the project

Welcome to the VN project. (The link uses "v-n" because Google Code does not allow two-character project names.)

VN is an experimental project to leverage the capabilities of Spin to teach nondeterminism within the context for finite automata.

Michal Armoni and I are very interested this subject so if you use VN we would appreciate hearing from you. We are interested in comments on the software, but even more so on your experience using it either in lectures or in labs and homework assignments.
