Welcome to the VN project. (The link uses "v-n" because Google Code does not allow two-character project names.)

VN is an experimental project to leverage the capabilities of the Spin Model Checker to teach nondeterminism within the context of finite automata.

Michal Armoni and I are very interested this subject, so if you use VN we would appreciate hearing from you. We are interested in comments on the software itself, but even more so on your experience using it either in lectures or in labs and homework assignments.

You might be interested in reading about our work on nondeterminism:
